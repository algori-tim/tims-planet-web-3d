      <h3>A Dive into Learning</h3>
      <p>
        Welcome to the Well of Knowledge on Tim's Planet! Just like any well, it's deep with stories and milestones.
        Here, I'd love to share with you the journey of my education - the foundation that supports all the creations
        and adventures you see around.
      </p>
      <h3>üå± The Early Years: A Missouri Beginning</h3>
      <p>
        My academic adventure began in the small, close-knit community of Gainesville, Missouri. It was here, amidst the
        rolling hills and friendly faces, that I attended kindergarten through 3rd grade. These early years were filled
        with the fundamental building blocks of education and set the stage for my lifelong love of learning.
      </p>
      <h3>üè† Homeschooling: A Personalized Path</h3>
      <p>
        From the 4th grade onward, my classroom was my home. Homeschooling allowed me to learn at my own pace, explore
        subjects that interested me deeply, and develop self-discipline and independent study skills. This unique
        experience culminated in me obtaining my GED at the age of 17, marking an early milestone in my academic
        journey.
      </p>
      <h3>üéì Ozarks Technical Community College: Achieving Excellence</h3>
      <p>
        After taking a few years to explore my interests and the world around me, I enrolled at Ozarks Technical
        Community College (OTC). During my time at OTC, I pursued an Associate of the Arts degree, a period marked by
        dedication and academic success. I found myself on the Dean's List for multiple semesters and graduated in 2016
        with a shining 4.0 GPA - a testament to my commitment and hard work.
      </p>
      <h3>üè¢ Missouri State University: Continuing To Grow</h3>
      <p>
        The journey didn't stop there. I transitioned seamlessly to Missouri State University, where I dove into the
        world of Computer Information Systems (CIS). These years were filled with intensive learning, practical
        application, and a growing passion for technology and its potential. In 2018, I graduated with 4.0 GPA and a
        Bachelor of Science in Computer Information Systems. My time at Missouri State was not just about grades - it
        was also about making a mark. I was honored with the "Outstanding CIS Student" award for the 2017-2018 academic
        year, a recognition that meant the world to me.
      </p>
      <h3>üåü A Journey of Growth and Learning</h3>
      <p>
        The Well of Knowledge here on Tim's Planet is a reflection of my educational path - a path characterized by
        curiosity, dedication, and the pursuit of excellence. From the small classrooms of Gainesville to the halls of
        Missouri State University, every step has contributed to who I am today - not just as a professional, but as a
        lifelong learner and explorer.
